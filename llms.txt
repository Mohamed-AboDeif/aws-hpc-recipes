# AWS HPC Recipes

> A comprehensive collection of infrastructure-as-code recipes for building High Performance Computing (HPC) systems on AWS using services like AWS Parallel Computing Service (PCS), ParallelCluster, Research and Engineering Studio (RES), and AWS Batch.

This repository contains 100+ tested recipes organized by HPC use case, from basic networking setups to advanced multi-user clusters with accounting. Each recipe includes CloudFormation templates, documentation, and quick-launch links for immediate deployment across all AWS regions including GovCloud.

Key technologies covered: AWS PCS, ParallelCluster, Slurm, EFA networking, FSx storage systems, EFS, S3, Graviton processors, and specialized HPC instance types.
